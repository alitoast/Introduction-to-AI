# Artificial Intelligence Projects – UC Pacman Series

**UC Pacman AI Project Suite**, a collection of three core AI projects focused on implementing intelligent behavior in the classic Pacman game. 

Here will be uploaded only the files modified as instructed in the projects directions. 
Further information and complete `.zip` files for each project can be found in the `Pacman Projects` at the lik: https://ai.berkeley.edu

## Project Overview

This repository is divided into three main parts:

---

###  1. Search Project

[Documentation](search/README.md)

Learn and implement fundamental uninformed and informed search algorithms to help Pacman navigate mazes and collect food. 

---

###  2. Multi-Agent Search

[Documentation](multi_agent_search/README.md)

Implement decision-making agents in adversarial environments with multiple agents (Pacman and ghosts). 

---

### 3. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

[Documentation](MDP/README.md)

Implement the Value Iteration algorithm to solve Markov Decision Processes and analyze how the algorithm’s hyperparameters (like discount factor and iteration count) affect policy convergence.
