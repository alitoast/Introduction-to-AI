# Artificial Intelligence Projects – UC Pacman Series

**UC Pacman AI Project Suite**, a collection of three core AI projects focused on implementing intelligent behavior in the classic Pacman game.

## Project Overview

This repository is divided into three main parts:

---

###  1. Search Project

[Documentation](search/README.md)

Learn and implement fundamental uninformed and informed search algorithms to help Pacman navigate mazes and collect food. Includes:

* Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
* A\* Search with heuristics


---

###  2. Multi-Agent Search

[Documentation](multi_agent_search/README.md)

Implement decision-making agents in adversarial environments with multiple agents (Pacman and ghosts). Includes:

* Reflex Agent
* Minimax Algorithm
* Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Expectimax Algorithm
* Custom Evaluation Heuristics


---

### 3. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

[Documentation](MDP/README.md)

Implement the Value Iteration algorithm to solve Markov Decision Processes and analyze how the algorithm’s hyperparameters (like discount factor and iteration count) affect policy convergence.

* Implement ValueIterationAgent in valueIterationAgents.py

* Analyze and interpret results in analysis.py
